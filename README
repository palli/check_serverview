 WHAT
===============
This Nagios Plugin gets hardware alerts from a FSC Primergy server through
SNMP.
 - environment (eg temperature, fans, case opening,...)
 - powersupply
 - massstorage (eg raid devices)
 - systemboard 
 - deployment (don't know...)
The FSC ServerView Agent must be installed and configured on the server.
The check_serverview.py is a rewrite of the check_serverview plugin in python,
which can also be found on www.nagiosexchange.org
The maint advantages of this plugin over the original check_serverview is
cleaner output and the ability to ignore certain subsystems.
For example the 'deployment' subsystem kept generating warnings, probably
because the server wasn't installed with the FSC ServerStart toolkit.

 INSTALLATION
===============
For the check_serverview.py plugin to work, it needs some python libraries installed.

1) check_serverview.py needs the following files in the same directory
 * schau_utils.py: Python library for fast nagios-plugin creation
 * schau_snmp.py: Python library for easy snmp1/2/3 access

 
2) schau_snmp.py depends on the following libraries
* PyCrypto
    http://pycrypto.sourceforge.net
    On CentOS with apt:
    apt-get install python-crypto
* PyASN1
    http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net
      wget http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pyasn1/pyasn1-0.0.6a.tar.gz
      tar -xzf pyasn1-0.0.6a.tar.gz
      cd pyasn1-0.0.6a
      python setup install
* pysnmp v4.1 (with snmpv3 support)
    http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net
      wget http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pysnmp/pysnmp-4.1.7a.tar.gz
      tar -xzf pysnmp-4.1.7a.tar.gz
      cd pysnmp-4.1.7a
      python setup install

 OPTIMIZATION
===============
Execution can be speed up by enabling python bytecode compilation. This is
done by granting the user running check_serverview.py rights to create
(or write to an existing) check_serverview.pyc file in the same directory.
e.g.
cd /usr/lib/nagios/plugins
touch check_serverview.pyc
chmod 755 check_serverview.pyc
chown nagios:nagios check_serverview.pyc
# repeat this for every .py plugin you have
